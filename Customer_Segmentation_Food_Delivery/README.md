# Project: Customer Segmentation for Food Delivery Company

A typical project related to marketing analytics where we have to divide a customer base into groups of people with similar interests, characteristics, etc.


The customer base of customers is the process of dividing into common characteristics, for companies that can market to each group of groups effectively and appropriately or simply the consumption pattern.

We can do the segmentation in several ways:

- age
- locality
- monthly spend of my company's products
- some other type of consumption
- by year, month, day, hour, seconds


In our case it will be done by food orders that are made.

We will separate customers by characteristics.

→ Do customers buy a specific type of food during the week or on the weekend?

→ Do customers buy these products with some kind of pattern?

→ For example, who buys chicken also buys dessert?

→ How can we group this type of customers by similarity?

→ Is there any pattern during daylight hours?

→ What are the critical periods of the day when the company needs to allocate a greater amount of resources to meet demand?

→ When demand is low, what can you do to prevent food from spoiling?



# B2B Marketing x B2C Marketing

In Business-to-Business (B2B) Marketing, a company can segment customers according to a wide variety of factors, including:

- Industry
- Number of employees
- Products previously purchased from the company
- Location

For example, raw material sales, a company that sells products to another company.

In Business-to-Consumer (B2C) Marketing, companies generally segment customers according to demographics and consumption patterns, such as:

- Age
- Genre
- Marital status
- Location (urban, suburban, rural)
- Life stage (no children, retired, etc.)
- Products purchased
- Amount spent
- Time of consumption


# Why Segment Customers?

Segmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various subsets of audiences. These efforts may be related to communications and product development. Specifically, segmentation helps a business to:

• Create and communicate targeted marketing messages that will resonate with specific groups of customers, but not others (who will receive messages tailored to their needs and interests).

• Select the best communication channel for the segment, which can be email, social media posts, radio advertising or another approach, depending on the segment.

• Identify ways to improve products or new product or service opportunities.

• Establish better customer relationships.

• Test pricing options.

• Focus on the most profitable customers.

• Improve customer service.

• Choose between wholesale and cross-sell other products and services.

# How to segment customers?

Customer segmentation requires a company to collect specific information - data - about customers and analyze it to identify patterns that can be used to create segments.

Some of this can be gleaned from purchasing information - title, geography, products purchased, for example. Some of them can be obtained from the way the customer entered your system. A marketer working with a subscription email list can segment marketing messages according to the subscription offer that attracted the customer, for example. Other information, however, including consumer demographics such as age and marital status, will need to be acquired in other ways.

Typical methods of gathering information include:

- Face-to-face or telephone interviews
- Researches
- Collection of published information about market categories
- Focus groups
- Access data to systems or apps

# Using customer segments

Common characteristics in customer segments can guide how a company markets individual segments and what products or services it promotes. A small company that sells handmade guitars, for example, may decide to promote lower-priced products to younger guitarists and higher-priced premium guitars to older musicians, based on industry knowledge that tells them that younger musicians young people have less disposable income than their older peers.

Customer segmentation can be practiced by all companies, regardless of size or industry, and whether they sell online or in person. It starts with collecting and analyzing data and ends with acting on the collected information in an appropriate and effective way, with the delivery of conclusions.
