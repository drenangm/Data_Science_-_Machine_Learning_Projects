# Recommendation system for Netflix movies


For all e-commerce businesses, it is likely that the recommendation are the most important analytical tool ever implemented. Although there is not official estimates, many sources estimate that, for the main platforms of e-commerce, such as Amazon and Netflix, recommendation systems can be responsible for up to 10% to 35% of the revenue of these companies. Those are considerable numbers. In a world with low growth, being able to increase your revenue by 10% makes
recommendation systems something we should look at more closely. Let's understand the these systems work.


Whenever we talk about some technology that can bring financial benefits to the company, which are significant, the investments in this technology are justified. And then we see an advantage of recommender systems (or perhaps one more). the cost of implementation of these systems is relatively low and their gains are substantial. Recommender systems are just one of many rapidly evolving specialties within predictive analytics and guaranteed work for Data Scientists.



## What Are Recommender Systems?

These are the applications that personalize the customer's shopping experience, recommending the next best options in light of your recent purchases or browsing activity.

Recommender Systems are, therefore, predictive models that, based on statistic, determine the probability that a customer will be interested in another item similar to what you are buying at any given time.

Recommender systems are simple, at least, in their objective.

But it is important to make it clear that while recommender systems are used in e-commerce applications where the customer is buying something, they are equally applicable in situations where you are trying to maximize user time on a website in order to increase advertising exposure. A good example is the Yahoo portal
that customizes your news feed so you spend more time on the site. This is a good example of application of recommender systems. You don't know (or at least you don't
knew until now), but the news that are being recommended to you on the portal aim to increase your exposure to the site's advertisers, who pay for exactly the number of views or clicks on your banners. Other examples of recommendation systems include associations and Market Basket Analysis which are so useful for activities of marketing.
